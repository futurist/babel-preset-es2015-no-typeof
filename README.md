# babel-preset-es2015-no-typeof
Transform the `typeof` is disgusting, so this repo will keep with `babel-preset-es2015`, but without `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-typeof-symbol`.

## Install

```sh
yarn add -D babel-preset-es6notypeof
```

Use that name since name include es2015 will marked as spamming name!
